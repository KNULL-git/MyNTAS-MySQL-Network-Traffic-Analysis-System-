# PCAP-Filter
This Python Script will allow its user to filter packets of a pcap file using the provided filters in it.
It is not similar to wireshark as in wireshark the packets captured are stored in a pcap file but here the packets will be stored in a mysql server the server credentials need to be changed and configured in the script by the user.
